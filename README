Welcome to Shrike.  This document is indended to familiarize new users with
Shrike.  For installation help, see the INSTALL file.

If you have any questions about this program not covered in any of the
documentation, or need help with the general operation of this program, ask
in #shrike on irc.malkier.net.

Shrike is a program designed for use on an IRC network.  It provides the
network with useful commands and most importantly IRC channel mangement.

Although Shrike isn't directly based on any other program, it borrows a
decent amount of code from Darcy Grexton's Cygnus IRC Services.  Credit is
given. The socket code is mostly from W. Campbell's Sentinel stats program.

To find out more about credit to given people, see the AUTHORS file.

Please check the CHANGES file to see all the features/changes done.

Shrike supports the following command-line options:

  * -c </path/to/file> - Specify the configuration file

  * -d                 - Start in debugging mode

  * -h                 - Print the help message and exit

  * -n                 - Run live (do not fork), used for debuggers

  * -v                 - Print the version information and exit

Shrike handles the following signals:

  * -HUP  - Force a REHASH

  * -TERM - Force a SHUTDOWN

  * -USR2 - Force a RESTART

Most of the commands are documented in COMMANDS and in HELP on IRC.

Shrike is known to work on the following IRCd's:

  * ratbox-1.3    (EFnet) - Shrike was designed and coded on this IRCd.

  * hybrid-7      (EFnet) - Shrike is known to work without issue on this IRCd.

Shrike is known NOT to work on the following IRCd's:

  * bahamut-1.4.x (DALnet) - This IRCd is not currently supported.

Shrike has only been tested with these IRCd's.  Shrike should work fine with
any hybrid-7/ratbox-1.3 or TSora based IRCd.  The IRCd must understand at
least version 3 of the TS protocol and the QS and EOB CAPAB's.

Okay, here's the deal.  We enjoy coding this program, and we do it for free.
You didn't pay anything for this, did you?  No.  Our time and effort went into
making this program, and now you want us to help you set it up, too.

Well, that's fine, but do us a favor:  READ THE DOCS.  Unlike many other
programs we've included some fairly extensive documentation.  The config file
itself has a description of every option, as well as examples of how it's
used, what it does, and what happens if you turn it on or off (see CONFIG).
PLEASE don't waste our time by asking asinine quesitons which are clearly
answered in the documentation.  You'll just annoy us and make us regret
making this program so easy to use that it requires zero intelligence.

That said, if you've skimmed the docs and can't find your answer, feel free
to ask.  I've been unable to find the answer I was looking for in many
programs myself, so I don't mind.  Just don't ask us to set it up for you.
It's amazingly easy.

We welcome (most) comments on this program.  Feel free to suggest changes or
new features.

If you've read this far, congratulations.  You are one of the few elite people
that actually read documentation.
