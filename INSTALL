This document will guide you through the process of installing Shrike.  For
general information about this program, see the README file.

If you have any problems with the installation procedure, or need help with
the general operation of this program, ask in #shrike on irc.malkier.net.

Shrike should compile and run on most POSIX compliant systems.  The list of
platforms that Shrike has been tested on includes:

  * FreeBSD 4.[89]/5.[012] - Compiles and runs with no issues

  * Linux (glibc) 2.4.x(*) - Compiles and runs with no issues

  * Solaris 8(*)           - Compiles and runs with no issues 

  * MacOS 10.3.3           - Compiles and runs with no issues

  * Other BSD-based systems will probably work.  Other SysV based systems
    MAY work, provided they support BSD sockets and POSIX function calls.  If
    there are any problems, patches, bug reports, or sucess stories, please
    let us know.

  * Items marked with (*) are known to compile in 64bit mode and work fine.

Shrike does not currently support IPv6.

Installation is relatively simple.

Here's the easy way: run the setup script. This does it all for you:

  $ ./setup

Follow the instructions and you're good to go.

Here's the slightly less easy but more traditional way:

Run the configure script.  In most cases you can run it with a command like:

  $ ./configure

If this fails, try:

  $ sh configure

After a few questions, the configure script will run several tests, write
several files, and exit.  Once this is done you will want to compile Shrike.
To do this, simply type:

  $ make

The program will compile.  When it's done, type:

  $ make install

The newly-compiled binary and several supporting files will be copied to the
directory you specified in the configure script.

Next, you'll want to go to the directory you told Shrike to install to and
edit etc/shrike.conf.  Read this file.  Yes!  Everyone!  This means you!
All of it!  Make us proud!

Once it's all set up, you can run Shrike with:

  $ ./bin/shrike

If you wish to prevent it from forking into the background, run it with:

  $ ./bin/shrike -n

To see other command-line options:

  $ ./bin/shrike -h

For more information see the README file.
