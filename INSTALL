You should also read the README and FAQ files.

1. INSTALLATION
---------------

IMPORTANT NOTE: it is not recommended to use (and therefore install) Shrike as
root. Use an unprivileged user account.

Shrike should compile and run on most POSIX compliant systems.  The list of
platforms that Shrike has been tested on includes:
  FreeBSD 4.[89]
  FreeBSD 5.[012]
  Linux (glibc) 2.4.x
  Solaris 8
  MacOS 10.3.3

Other BSD-based systems will probably work. Other SysV-based systems *might*
work provided they support BSD sockets and POSIX function calls.

The easy way: run the "setup" script. This does it all for you:
  $ ./setup

Follow the instructions and you're good to go.

The slightly less easy but more traditional way:

Run the "configure" script:
  $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/

The "configure" script will run several tests, write several files, and exit.
Once this is done you will want to compile Shrike. To do this, simply type:
  $ make

Shrike will compile. To install, type:
  $ make install

The newly-compiled binary and several supporting files will be copied to the
directory you specified in the "configure" script.

Next, you'll want to go to the directory you specified in "configure" and edit
etc/shrike.conf. You'll need to change every setting or Shrike will not work.

2. UPGRADING
------------

IMPORTANT NOTE: backup your configuration file and database!

Sometimes upgrading requires more than recompiling and reinstalling. Be sure to
read doc/RELEASE for important notes concerning the release. This file will
let you know if you need to change your configuration or convert your database
to a new format.

3. SETTING UP IRCD
------------------

Shrike acts as an IRC server with pseudo-clients on it. To link it to your
network, you'll need to add some lines in your IRCd's configuration.

This is where I can't help you. Every IRCd is different. Look for documentation
for "connect{}" or "link{}" or "C/N lines" for your IRCd.

To be perfectly honest, if you can't figure this out you should be running
neither IRCd nor services.

4. STARTING SHRIKE
------------------

Go into the directory where you installed Shrike (by default, ~/shrike/).
Type ./bin/shrike to launch Shrike.

Shrike will report any errors and/or detach into the background.

If Shrike doesn't link and/or terminates without warning check the log
file (var/shrike.log) to see what happened. If this tells you nothing try
rerunning Shrike via ./bin/shrike -dn for more verbose information.
