1. INSTALLATION
---------------

IMPORTANT NOTE: it is not recommended to use (and therefore install) Shrike as
root. Use an unprivileged user account.

Shrike should compile and run on most POSIX compliant systems.  The list of
platforms that Shrike has been tested on includes:
  FreeBSD 4.[89]
  FreeBSD 5.[012]
  Linux (glibc) 2.4.x
  Solaris 8
  MacOS 10.3.3

Other BSD-based systems will probably work. Other SysV-based systems *might*
work provided they support BSD sockets and POSIX function calls.

The easy way: run the "setup" script. This does it all for you:
  $ ./setup

Follow the instructions and you're good to go.

The slightly less easy but more traditional way:

Run the "configure" script:
  $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/

If you're running a large network (more than 2000 users) I suggest passing the
--enable-large-net switch to configure.

The "configure" script will run several tests, write several files, and exit.
Once this is done you will want to compile Shrike. To do this, simply type:
  $ make

Shrike will compile. To install, type:
  $ make install

The newly-compiled binary and several supporting files will be copied to the
directory you specified in the "configure" script.

Next, you'll want to go to the directory you specified in "configure" and edit
etc/shrike.conf. You'll need to change every setting or Shrike will not work.

2. UPGRADING
------------

IMPORTANT NOTE: backup your configuration file and database!

Sometimes upgrading requires more than recompiling and reinstalling. Be sure to
read doc/RELEASE for important notes concerning the release. This file will
let you know if you need to change your configuration or convert your database
to a new format.

3. SETTING UP IRCD
------------------

Shrike acts as an IRC server with pseudo-clients on it. To link it to your
network, you'll need to add some lines in your IRCd's configuration.

This is where I can't help you. Every IRCd is different. Look for documentation
for "connect{}" or "link{}" or "C/N lines" for your IRCd.

To be perfectly honest, if you can't figure this out you should be running
neither IRCd nor services.

4. STARTING SHRIKE
------------------

Go into the directory where you installed Shrike (by default, ~/shrike/).
Type ./bin/shrike to launch Shrike.

Shrike will report any errors and/or detach into the background.

If Shrike doesn't link and/or terminates without warning check the log
file (var/shrike.log) to see what happened. If this tells you nothing try
rerunning Shrike via ./bin/shrike -dn for more verbose information.

5. SETTING UP A CRONTAB ENTRY
-----------------------------

A crontab entry will allow you to check periodically whether Shrike is still
running, and restart it if not. You'll need to have Shrike binaries and data
installed in the same directory for this to work without modification.

First rename the dist/shrike.chk script that is in Shrike path (by default, 
~/shrike/) and edit it. You'll need to modify the "cd" part of the file.
Then ensure that the file is marked as executable by typing
"chmod +x shrike.chk," and try to launch the script to see if it works.

When this is done, you'll have to add the crontab entry. Type "crontab -e"
This will open the default text editor with the crontab file. Enter the
following (with correct path):
*/5 * * * * /home/rakaur/shrike/etc/shrike.chk >/dev/null 2>&1
The */5 at the beginning means "check every 5 minutes." You may replace
the 5 with other another number if you want (but less than 60). Save and exit,
and it's installed.
