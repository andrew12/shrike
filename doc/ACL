Try to work out a more complicated, but user-friendly access list
system. People like Atheme's flags, even though one-character mode flags
are insanely user-unfriendly. We can accomplish some fine-grained control
beyond xOP by using "flags" that have full names, like current flags used
in "SET." We also need an AKICK system. This also means I'll have to
change the DB, and possibly provide a converter (for CA entries at least).

ACL <#chan> GRANT <user> <flag>
ACL <#chan> REVOKE <user> <flag>

ACL <#chan> <user> <+/-><flag>

ACL <#chan> SET <user> <flag>
ACL <#chan> UNSET <user> <flag>

Flags (Atheme's list):

   VOICE - Enables use of the voice/devoice commands.
   AUTOVOICE - Enables automatic voice.
   OP - Enables use of the op/deop commands.
   AUTOOP - Enables automatic op.
   SET - Enables use of the set command.
   INVITE - Enables use of the invite and getkey commands.
   +r - Enables use of the kick, kickban, ban and unban commands.
   RECOVER - Enables use of the recover and clear commands.
   ACL - Enables modification of channel access lists.
   +t - Enables use of the topic and topicappend commands.
   ACLVIEW - Enables viewing of channel access lists.
   +F - Grants full founder access.
   AUTOKICK - Enables automatic kickban.

The special permission +* adds all permissions except +b and +F.
The special permission -* removes all permissions including +b and +F.

NOTE: Differentiate between VOICE/AUTOVOICE etc? What's the point?
NOTE: +r seems redundant since ACL would allow setting AUTOKICK
      and shrike has no "kick, kickban, ban, and unban" commands.
NOTE: +t is stupid. Channels already do that for us.
NOTE: +F is... crazy. I think I prefer FOUNDER/SUCCESSOR.
NOTE: Leave current xOP system in place as a shortcut for
      adding a subset of flags?
