. What is Shrike?

Shrike is a set of services for IRC networks. Shrike is designed for TSora
(hybrid/ratbox/csircd) networks around the idea that nicknames are not owned
but channels can be.

Where can I find Shrike?
------------------------

The latest version can always be found at the official homepage:
http://shrike.malkier.net/.

New version annoucements will also be on the mailing list:
shrike@lists.malkier.net.

Does Shrike run under Windows?
------------------------------

No. There are no plans for Shrike to ever be ported to Windows.

Cygwin might work.

If you feel capable of taking ownership of an official Windows port, and to
keep it current, please let us know.

Why TSora? What about other IRCd's?
-----------------------------------

We developed Shrike for TSora-based networks (ratbox/hybrid) because that's
what we use. Most of the developers hang out on EFnet. Also, Shrike was written
for use on the Malkier IRC Network, which runs ircd-ratbox.

Support for other IRCds is planned at some distant point in the future. By
"other IRCds" we really mean other TSora IRCds like csircd among others run on
EFnet. We had planned on supporting bahamut, unfortunately the latest release
(1.4.36) completely breaks TS without specifiying a standard. We've determined
the small demand for 1.4.35 support isn't worth all the work it would require.
As Unreal is a very common IRCd, support for 3.2 is planned. Someday.

I just upgraded and Shike crashes while loading the databases!
--------------------------------------------------------------

The database format probably changed. Once we go 1.0 if we change the db format
we will supply you with a converter. Until then you're just going to have to
live with it. It's a bummer, we know.

Why usernames instead of nicknames?
-----------------------------------

As you may know, most TSora networks frown upon nickname registration. We are
no different. We believe that nicknames are not owned because you cannot own
your real name either. So, for a middle ground you register a username which is
completely seperate from your nickname.

Shrike crashed.
---------------

That sucks.

If you can reproduce it, report it on the forums and we'll fix it if we can
reproduce it. If we can't, then you're out of luck.

If you got a corefile (core on Linux, shrike.core on others) run this on your
shell:

$ gdb bin/shrike shrike.core
(gdb) bt

And give us the results in the forums.

Shrike ignored SET SUCCESSOR and let the channel expire.
--------------------------------------------------------

This is usually because the SUCCESSOR had too many channels registered.

When I used RAW and/or INJECT Shrike/my network crashed!
--------------------------------------------------------

RAW and INJECT are not supported for exactly that reason. You're on your own.
They're disabled by default for a reason.

What are those numbers when it replies to a CTCP CLIENTINFO?
------------------------------------------------------------

That's an easter egg; you'll have to figure it out for yourself.

A note for smartasses: don't post the answer on the forums.

What's all that crap in the VERSION reply?
------------------------------------------

Lots of things. First, it says "shrike-," followed by the version, then it gives
the name of its server, then it gives a bunch of letters:

  A - using ASCII casemapping
  d - debug mode is on
  e - email auth is on
  F - flood protection is on
  l - leave_chans is on
  j - join_chans is on
  n - running live (nofork)
  R - using rfc1459 casemapping
  r - raw/inject are enabled

Whenever I run Shrike I get an error from the IRC server!
---------------------------------------------------------

It depends on the error. Typically, it means you don't have your IRCd set up
to handle Shrike's connection. We will not help you with this. This is an IRCd
configuration issue, not services. If you can't figure it out you probably
shouldn't be running either. If you see something like "non-TS server" or
similiar: as of this writting, Shrike only offically supports version 5 of the
TS protocol. The latest version of TS is version 6, which changes the
fundamentals of user and server tracking, and has not been implemented in
Shrike. TS is short for TSora, which is short for timestamp orabidoo.
orabidoo is the nickname of the person who first implemented TS on EFnet.
TS is a system of timestampping nicknames and channels so that disputes between
them when servers link are easily resolved based on "who came first." TS6
changes many things in the server-to-server protocol and was heavily
implemented after Shrike had begun development speaking TS5. Support for TS6
is not currently planned. This isn't a big deal because any server speaking
TS6 should still speak TS5 as well.

Shrike won't even start.
------------------------

Run Shrike with -dn to see what the problem is. If this doesn't output anything
something is seriously messed up in the configuration file.
