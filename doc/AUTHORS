  * William Pitcock <nenolod@nenolod.net>

Roles of the above:

  * Stephen Belcher - Supporting developer, supporting programmer
  * Matt Lanigan    - Supporting developer, supporting programmer

Shrike is competely written from the ground up.  When I say this I mean I
opened a blank file in vi and started coding it.

The original Makefile is by Darcy Grexton.
Some of the basic functions in function.c are also stolen from him.

The socket code, although modified, is based on W. Campbell's.
A lot of information has come from W. Campbell.  He has helped me in more ways
than I can thank him for.  Shrike wouldn't be where it is without his continued
patience and understanding.

The idea for the generic linked list (node.c) was stolen from ircd-hybrid's
dlink.c library.  I wrote mine from scratch, though.

The concept for the config-file was thrown in by Steve.  He also provided
original Perl code to parse the file, which I later ported to C.

Barry Boyce coded the original Shrike Website.
